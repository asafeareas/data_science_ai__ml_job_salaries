# data science, ai & ml job salaries analysis

this project analyzes salaries for data science, artificial intelligence, and machine learning jobs using a public dataset. the goal is to explore salary trends, job roles, company locations, and other factors that influence compensation in these fields.

## project overview

- data cleaning and preprocessing
- exploratory data analysis (eda)
- salary distribution by job title, experience, and location
- visualization of key insights
- conclusions and recommendations

## dataset

the dataset contains information about job titles, salaries, company locations, employment types, and experience levels for roles in data science, ai, and ml. it was sourced from kaggle and includes data from multiple countries and years.

## main steps

1. import and inspect the dataset
2. clean and preprocess the data (handle missing values, format columns)
3. perform exploratory data analysis:
   - salary distribution
   - job title frequency
   - salary by experience level
   - salary by company location
   - remote vs on-site salary comparison
4. visualize findings using matplotlib and seaborn
5. summarize key insights

## requirements

- python 3.7+
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn

to install the required packages, run:

```
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn
```

## usage

1. clone this repository or download the notebook.
2. open the notebook in jupyter or google colab.
3. run all cells to reproduce the analysis and visualizations.

## results

- senior roles and us-based companies tend to offer higher salaries.
- remote positions are increasingly common and often pay competitively.
- significant salary variation exists between countries and job titles.
- experience level is a strong predictor of salary.

## visualizations

the notebook includes various charts such as:

- salary distribution histograms
- boxplots by job title and location
- bar charts for experience levels
- heatmaps for correlation analysis

## conclusion

this analysis provides insights into the salary landscape for data science, ai, and ml professionals. it can help job seekers, employers, and researchers understand current trends and make informed decisions.
